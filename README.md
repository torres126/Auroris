Club Penguin Rewritten's old server emulator - used for production

All code is owned by Hagrid and was created for Club Penguin Rewritten (cprewritten.net), which was discontinued on March 4th 2018. As of April 26th 2018, it can be played at cprewritten.net. 

I probably won't be creating tutorials on how to set this up or be updating the code, so feel free to modify it.

Please do not use this emulator for a CPR clone/rip-off.

The SQL database structure will need to be remade by you if you intend to use it.
Hmu on Twitter (@tim_rollinson) for any queries.
